## Aerospace Workspace Objects ##

There are two custom UI objects that have been developed specifically for Aerospace applications: a Climb Gauge and Altitude Indicator. These gauges are based off of NI VeriStand's native indicators, but have a different visual look.

For the Aerospace - Climb Gauge, the max and min values for the indicator should be set as desired / appropriate (Ex. -180 to 180 ; -90 to 90, 0 to 180, etc).

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2011

### Quality, Limitations ###

These are two very simple workspace objects that have been used for many years. They should be considered mature and high quality.
